    <p>Tylie meant a lot to our family, being what we called “our miracle” to have beat the odds and live thirty-five love-filled years. She was a sense of comfort, a symbol of strength, and a reminder that purity exists in the physical form.</p>
    <p>Tylie had a gift of lighting up a space with her laughter. No one could prevent a smile from curling their lips when her angelic chuckles filled the room. </p>
    <p>She had a child-like presence that compelled one to wrap her in their arms and keep her safe from harm, while also wielding a no nonsense look and a right hook that told you she was just as strong as any other.</p>
    <p>As a little girl, when she would blow raspberries at the ceiling and laugh, Mom would say, “She’s playing with the angels.” Tylie will forever be surrounded by angelic playmates in heaven, alongside all of our passed loved ones who have left us with their memory. </p>
    <p>We love and miss you, Tylie.</p>
